emu8086 supports additional devices that can be created by anyone.

there are 7 example devices:

  Simple.exe
  LED_Display.exe
  Thermometer.exe
  Printer.exe                (written by Andrew Nelis)
  Robot.exe
  Stepper_motor.exe
  Thermometer.exe
  Traffic_Lights.exe  

source code for these devices can be found in c:\emu8086\DEVELOPER
these devices are programmed in visual basic; other languages (java, borland turbo c, c#, delphi...)
also can be used - all you have to do is to get access to this file: c:\emu8086.io

to write your own device using visual basic, all you have to do is to include io.bas
module into your project, and use pre-made subs and functions
 (look inside that file for more information).

    for visual basic 6.0 include io.bas
    for visual basic .net include io.vb
    for c/c++ include io.h
    for visual c# include io.cs           (written by deTrox Yang)
    for Delphi include io.pas

avaiable input / output addresses for custom devices are from 0 to 65535 (0 to 0FFFFh) 

port 100 corresponds to byte 100 in this file c:\emu8086.io, port 101 to the byte 101, port 0 to byte 0 etc...


if new devices are put into this folder: c:\emu8086\devices, they are automatically added
to virtual devices menu of the emulator when it starts.
device is activated when its file name is found anywhere in comments or in string buffers.
